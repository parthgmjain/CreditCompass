Inspiration A few weeks ago, we were talking to some of our friends, and we learned that many of them had never even thought about getting a credit card because they were terrified of ruining their future. We realized that the fear of making the wrong financial move was holding them back from something that could actually be a stepping stone to financial independence. It broke our hearts to see so many people struggling with the idea of taking that first step, not realizing that with the right guidance, a credit card can be a powerful tool for building long-term stability. We want to change that. Our mission is to help our peers take control of their financial future with confidence, so they don’t have to live in fear of making mistakes that could hold them back for years to come.

What it does We have 2 features powered by Letta: Our first feature is an intuitive AI chatbot designed to make credit card decision-making simple. It helps users navigate everyday situations—like when you're at the grocery store and unsure which card offers the best benefits. With Letta’s memory, the chatbot remembers the credit cards you own and uses real-time data to provide personalized recommendations, ensuring you’re maximizing the benefits of each card. It will tell you exactly which one to use to get the most out of every purchase.

The second feature, also powered by Letta, is a personalized questionnaire that helps users choose the best credit cards for their long-term financial goals. By considering preferences like cashback, travel rewards, and more, it generates a tailored list of around five cards that align with their needs, empowering them to make smarter choices.

How We Built It We built CreditCompass using Flask integrated with the Letta API, with HTML and CSS for the frontend to create a smooth user interface. For the backend, we utilized Python with Firebase to manage user authentication securely.

Challenges We Ran Into One of the biggest challenges we faced was the steep learning curve in integrating the Letta AI. As a new program, it took some time to understand how to effectively implement its features. However, once we overcame that hurdle, the system came together seamlessly, and we were able to leverage Letta’s full potential.

Accomplishments We’re Proud Of We’re incredibly proud of getting the Letta-powered chatbot up and running, with its memory feature that personalizes responses based on the user’s credit card data. It’s rewarding to see how this enhances user experience and helps people make smarter decisions.
